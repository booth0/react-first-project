# Overview
With this program, my goal was to learn the basics of using React. I specifically learned how to take user inputs and use them as variables as well as creating new elements using the JavaScript code.

The purpose of this program is to save the names and descriptions of future events that the user would like to remember. To use it, the user will need to input the name and description of a future event, press the 'Create Event' button, and have it added into a box for a reminder. 

This program can be ran by first opening the terminal in the react-first-project folder, entering the command 'npm install' to make sure all the necessary files are installed, then enter 'npm start' to run the application in the browser.
